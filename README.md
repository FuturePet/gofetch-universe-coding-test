# GoFetch Universe coding test

_Welcome, traveler_ üë©‚ÄçüöÄ _, to the Orion VII Station!_

_I see your starship is full of goods. We buy many of those goods here!_

_You may wish to sell some. I see you have a dashboard of your ships inventory and our market buy prices. I recommend building something to see what will provide you the most profit if you sell. There are no limits on what you can sell here._

Your task:

- update the inventory-vs-orion-seven file to provide data to the existing PotentialProfits molecules, which will display the potential profits you can make from selling your ships inventory at Orion 7. You will need to update that molecule. **Sort the list by most profitable**.

Overview:

- Take about 30 minutes to achieve this.
  - You may want to focus on code organization over visual design (the dashboard doesn't have to look good, but your code should).
  - **You can verbally tell us what specific improvements you would make**, without having to make them.
- We'll make sure that there are 15 minutes left at the end for questions.
- Your goal is to do your best, not to "make it to the finish line". Talk it through with us.
- Have fun!!
